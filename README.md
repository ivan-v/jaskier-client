# Jaskier Client
## Web Interface for [Virtual Bard](http://virtualbard.com)

## Motivation
The benefits and conveniences of having tools and applications be on the web are countless. 
For this reason, I've decided to make a few tools for music composition powered by my [Jaskier Python music generation library](https://github.com/ivan-v/jaskier) as web apps.

## Future Work
- [ ] Implement sheet music conversion and export, like I've done [here](https://ivan-v.github.io/carolan-client/index.html) ([source](https://github.com/ivan-v/carolan-client)).
- [ ] More jazz-related tools
- [ ] Live-coding tool
- [ ] Live MIDI input, through the same way I've done [here](https://ivan-v.github.io/Piano-Scribe/) ([source](https://github.com/ivan-v/Piano-Scribe)).
